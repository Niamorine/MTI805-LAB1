# MTI805-LAB1

This repo contains the code I used for Lab-1 of the MTI805 class at ETS Montreal during the 2025 Winter session.

The script `images_detection.py` was used to detect faces and eyes in images in an input directory, and output the images with the detected objects highlighted in an output directory

The script `video_face_tracking.py` was used to do real-time face and eyes tracking with a webcam. After starting the script, the camera output is played back with the detected objects highlighted in a window.

Both use OpenCV's cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes.
